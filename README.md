# NDHU-Programming-Language-and-Compiler-Project
1. Use lex (or flex) and yacc (or bison) to implement a front end (including a lexical
analyzer and a syntax recognizer) of the compiler for the T language, showing the
grammar rules applied while parsing.
Ø See an attached file for the lexical rules in details.
Ø You are requested to separate the C code, the lex/flex specification, the
yacc/bison specification into distinct files.
